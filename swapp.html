					<h1>1.</h1>
					<p>Many of the people we interviewed said that they swapped shifts by texting coworkers. Most found this process too informal, disorganized, and inefficient.</p>

					<p>From online research, we found that shift-swapping can be an issue when different jobs require specialized skills.</p>

				<div id = "col">
					<h1>3.</h1>
					<p>Through our competitive analysis, we found that calendars did not show all employee shifts, making shift swapping more difficult to coordinate.</p>
